# Detection of Blindness Severity in Diabetic Rectinopathy
The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify images on the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy of the patient's eye. The models used should be able to work fast on the input images and have enough accuracy to be able to be used by a doctor reliably.
It is a multiclass classification problem with the class labels as,
  0- No DR,
  1- Mild,
